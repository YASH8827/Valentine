# 💖 Valentine's Love Hub for Surbhi

A beautiful, interactive Valentine's Day experience.

## 🚀 Troubleshooting the Website

If your site `https://yash8827.github.io/Valentine/` is not opening, please check the following:

### 1. Case Sensitivity
GitHub Pages URLs are **case-sensitive**. 
* If your repository is named `Valentine`, use `https://yash8827.github.io/Valentine/`.
* If your repository is named `valentine`, use `https://yash8827.github.io/valentine/`.

### 2. Check the Deployment Status
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the **Actions** tab.
3. Look for a workflow named **"pages build and deployment"**.
4. If it has a red 'X', it failed. If it has a green checkmark, your site is live!

### 3. React/TypeScript on GitHub Pages
Browsers cannot read `.tsx` files directly. To host this on GitHub Pages:
* You should ideally use a build tool like **Vite**.
* If you are just uploading raw files, they must be compiled to `.js`.
* **Pro Tip:** For a React app like this, it is much easier to use **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** or **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)**. You just connect your GitHub account, select the repo, and they handle the hosting and mobile optimization perfectly for free!
