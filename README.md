# 💖 Valentine's Love Hub for Surbhi

A beautiful, interactive Valentine's Day experience.

## 🚀 How to Host on GitHub (For Mobile Access)

To share this with Surbhi so she can open it on her phone, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository
* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository named `valentine-for-surbhi`.
* Keep it **Public**.

### 2. Upload the Files
* You can use the GitHub Desktop app or the command line:
  ```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Happy Valentine's Day"
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/valentine-for-surbhi.git
  git push -u origin main
  ```
* *Alternatively:* You can just drag and drop the files directly into the GitHub website upload interface.

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
* In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** (top tab).
* Click on **Pages** (left sidebar).
* Under **Build and deployment**, set the source to **Deploy from a branch**.
* Select the **main** branch and the **/(root)** folder.
* Click **Save**.

### 4. Open on Mobile
* After a minute, GitHub will give you a link (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/valentine-for-surbhi/`).
* Copy this link and send it to Surbhi! It is fully responsive and works perfectly on all mobile browsers.
